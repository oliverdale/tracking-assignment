ENMT482 Particle Filter Assignment
==================================

The only files that need editing are `demo.py` and `models.py`.  Look for
the TODOs! 

The data is in the file `data.csv`.

Some useful functions can be found in `utils.py`

The program to run is `demo.py`.  Spyder provides a nice IDE if you are
not used to python.

You can test your motion model by running `motion-model-test`.py.  You
will need to temporarily disable adding randomness to your particle
poses when running this test.

The video on Learn shows the operation for a similar particle filter solving
the localisation problem.  It orients the world differently.
